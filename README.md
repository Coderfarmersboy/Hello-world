# Hello-world
My first code repository
Hello my dreams,
You know that we have been dreaming of becoming a world-class coder for some time. Do you remember we have been dreaming about coding since 2010 and before. So today we commit to invest small chunks of daily time and energy to make you- my dream, come true.
With your realization we will create together to serve the humanity and the world in our own small ways.
Yours sincerely the dreamer of the dreams.
